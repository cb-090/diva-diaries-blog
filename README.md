# Diva Diaries
## By Cara Babin and Tara Ramanathan

Diva Diaries is a trivial blog app created with Vite and a base skeleton using React and Firebase. Users can log in through Firebase's Google Authentication to view articles written and published to an internal database. Once logged in, users can also publish their own articles for the world to see, but writing is currently limited while the app is still being developed. Other features include a navigation bar to move between articles, time stamps of each article's publication date, and a responsive layout for both web and mobile devices.

__Note:__ To return to the home page to browse articles after clicking the "New Article" button, you have to refresh the page.
